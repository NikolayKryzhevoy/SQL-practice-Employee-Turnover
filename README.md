# SQL-practice-Employee-Turnover

The cost of employee turnover has been attracting considerable attention. A high turnover rate not only increases human resource costs, 
but also has social costs, correlating with lower wages, lower productivity per employee, and a less loyal workforce. 

Happyforce is a mobile app which is intended to improve communication between employees, to help understand their worries
and thus, create a more productive company (myhappyforce.com). With Happyforce, the employees may anonymously report their daily 
happiness levels at work and companies may track happiness of the workforce. The procedure is simple:

1) After opening the app, an employee is requested to answer the question: How happy are you at work today? 
To vote the employee indicates their feeling by touching one of the following four icons appearing on the screen.

4 Great

3 Good

2 So So

1 Pretty Bad 

2) After the employee indicates their happiness level, a second screen appears where he/she can optionally provide a text explanation 
(usually a complaint, suggestion or comment). 
3) Finally, in a third screen the employee can see all comments and like or dislike them.

The interaction of employees (37 companies) with the Happyforce app as well as their present status (staying or quit) is stored in four
databases available at https://www.kaggle.com/harriken/employeeturnover

In this project I have performed an exploratory data analysis of these databases. 
As tools, I used SQLite and (rather poor) visualization methods of the Database Browser for SQLite.  

The goal is to clarify the characteristics of employees that will churn (or that are at risk of churning), 
to help companies understand the causes so they can reduce the turnover rate.
